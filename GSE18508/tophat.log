[2014-07-31 10:32:59] Preparing reads
	 left reads: min. length=37, max. length=37, 12205959 kept reads (24143 discarded)
	right reads: min. length=37, max. length=37, 12166707 kept reads (63395 discarded)
Warning: you have only one segment per read.
	If the read length is greater than or equal to 45bp,
	we strongly recommend that you decrease --segment-length to about half the read length because TopHat will work better with multiple segments
