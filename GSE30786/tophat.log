[2014-08-21 16:09:02] Generating SAM header for genome
[2014-08-21 16:09:19] Preparing reads
	 left reads: min. length=40, max. length=40, 36814439 kept reads (16915 discarded)
Warning: you have only one segment per read.
	If the read length is greater than or equal to 45bp,
	we strongly recommend that you decrease --segment-length to about half the read length because TopHat will work better with multiple segments
