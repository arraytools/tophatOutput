[2014-07-11 22:29:09] Generating SAM header for genome
[2014-07-11 22:29:25] Preparing reads
	 left reads: min. length=36, max. length=36, 36330026 kept reads (39930 discarded)
Warning: you have only one segment per read.
	If the read length is greater than or equal to 45bp,
	we strongly recommend that you decrease --segment-length to about half the read length because TopHat will work better with multiple segments
